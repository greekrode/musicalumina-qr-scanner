# Musica Lumina â€“ QR Scanner PWA

A lightweight Progressive Web App for fast event check-ins. Built for the **Musica Lumina** competition, it scans QR codes, decodes embedded JWT payloads, and verifies participant data against a Supabase database â€” all behind a Clerk-powered login.

## âœ¨ Tech Stack

## ðŸš€ What does it do?

1. User signs in via Clerk.
2. App accesses the camera and scans QR codes.
3. If the QR contains a JWT, the signature is verified and the payload decoded.
4. Participant info in the token is cross-checked with Supabase to confirm authenticity (with smart local caching to avoid rate limits).
5. Results are displayed instantly, along with scan history and optional deep links.

That's it â€” a fast, themed QR scanning tool for smooth, reliable on-site registrations.
